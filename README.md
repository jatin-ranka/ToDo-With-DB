## Problem Description

To complete this milestone you have to make the following 3 programs work:

list-todos.rb,
add-todo.rb, and
complete-todo.rb


The exact code for all three of these files will be provided in the following sections. The only thing you need to do is to fill in the `todo.rb` file (the ActiveRecord model) with appropriate methods so that these three files work correctly.
